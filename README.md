# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This is a basic planner that lets users schedule their work day hours. The hour blocks are color coded in relation to the current hour. Red for current hour, green for future hours and gray for past hours.

The scheduled events are saved and retrieved to and from the local storage of the user's browser respectively. This ensures the rendering of the events even after the user refreshes the browser.

To replace a scheduled event, delete the previous one and save the new event.

To delete a scheduled event without replacing, delete the existing event and save. Another option is to clear the local storage.

*The 5pm block is red, and the rest grayish because that was time the screenshot was taken.
